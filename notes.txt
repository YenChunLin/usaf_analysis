  NB had to change camera settings - instead of ISO 100 and then halving the exposure time, used ISO 320 and did not decrease the exposure time after fixing the camera settings.
20171003: thorlabs_100x_plan
  Due to the smaller step sizes needed, I added a line of code to reduce the backlash value for the distortion measurements (otherwise it moved back and forth between each pair of images, which is counterproductive).  I kept the ISO 320 and non-reduction of exposure time (100x with the same illumination should get 2.5^2 times less light).

  As above - but I'm now slightly worried there wasn't enough immersion oil.
20171006: thorlabs_100x_EP_2
  Added the backlash logic above to scan_edge (previously it was only in measure_distortion) and reduced the minimum z step to 30 (50 for autofocus), as the focal depth of the 100x objective is rather smaller.
20171009: re-took distortion_h and distortion_v for pilens_2_ss
  Realised the horizontal edge distortion images were moving in the wrong direction, so re-took them.
